# CelebsDontCare

After looking at this post from Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott, it 
makes you think if you are really making a change. You know? I stopped 
using straws, did it matter? Well... maybe not as much as I think but I am 
helping even if it's the smallest of changes. Either way, how much are 
celebrities are polluting? Well we can find out using this tool.

## UPDATE

As of December 15, 2022 this app will not update or gather any more data. :( 
Unfortunately Elon Musk (new twitter CEO) decided to [suspend the accounts](https://fortune.com/2022/12/15/elon-musk-private-jet-twitter-account-suspended-free-speech-jack-sweeney/) 
needed to gather the data used in this site. I did not have a back up of the previously 
recorded data so everything gathered is now gone. This was a project to show my 
friend that celebrities don't care about the environment. If you would like to educate 
yourself more here are some articles on the topic :).
